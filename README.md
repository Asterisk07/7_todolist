<h2>  Why Express ? </h2> 
I wanted to try out and explore express .

<h2> Why SQL over NoSQL? </h2>
SQL databases are better suited for handling complex queries and relationships between data, which my todolist app will contain, like filtering/searching based on labels, due dates, keywords etc.

<h2> Why Sqlite3 ? </h2>
It is one of the most hassle free Sql-based systems i've used so far and it doesnr require much setup, unlike MySQL, so I prefer it.
